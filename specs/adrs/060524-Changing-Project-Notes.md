# Changing Project Notes

## Context and Problem Statement

The team showed the professor the current project in week 10 to get his opinion since we have only been talking with the TAs. He did not like some aspects of the project. One such area is the project notes. How should the project notes be changed to look better?

## Considered Options

* Improve on the save code snippets element
* Change the save code snippet element to saving screenshots in general
* Remove the save code snippets element and add an option to type entries in markdown and display the markdown file

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Remove the save code snippets element and add an option to type entries in markdown and display the markdown file", because it saves visual space on the page and allows users more options for formatting the text entries.
