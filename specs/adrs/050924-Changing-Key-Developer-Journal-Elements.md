# Changing Key Developer Journal Elements

## Context and Problem Statement

We noticed that the original focus of the developer journal could have included more project and journal specific elements. 

## Considered Options

* Rework or remove the Work Experience page
* Rework or remove the Skills page
* Implement pages for specific projects
* Implement a to-do list function for the project
* Implement a notes function to write down notes, documentation, code snippets, etc.
* Implement public blog functionality
* Implement a timeline functionality

## Decision Outcome

Chosen options: 
* "Implement pages for specific projects", "Implement a to-do list function for the project", and "Implement a notes function to write down notes, documentation, code snippets, etc.", because the focus of the project was changed to include more journal elements that developers can use.
* "Rework or remove the Work Experience page" and "Rework or remove the Skills page", because in addition to focusing on the functionality and quality of the journal elements, we wanted to reduce the scope of the other project elements

## More Information

The current pages and elements planned for the project include: A login page for users, a homepage that presents user information and project info cards for navigation, and project pages that save milestone information, task lists, and notes for each project.
