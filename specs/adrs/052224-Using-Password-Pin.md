# Using Password Pin

## Context and Problem Statement

For the project, we wanted to add a login feature with usernames and passwords. What is the best way to implement passwords within the given time we have?

## Considered Options

* Using alphanumeric passwords
* Using PINs for passwords

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: "Using PINS for passwords", because it would be easier for initial implementation and testing using local files

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Using alphanumeric passwords
* Good, because it adds more security.
* Bad, because implementation and testing would take longer.

### Using PINs for passwords
* Good, because implementation and testing would be better and faster.
* Bad, because it is less secure.
