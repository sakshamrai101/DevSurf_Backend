# Changing Project Scrolling

## Context and Problem Statement

As a result of the home page layout change, the project cards also had to change to fit the layout. The initial layout had the project cards scrolling left to right. With the new layout, how should the scrolling change

## Considered options

* Keep the scrolling left to right
* Change the scrolling to up and down

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: “Change the scrolling to up and down”, because it is easier to implement and saves horizontal space by removing the left and right arrows.
