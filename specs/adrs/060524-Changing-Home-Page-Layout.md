# Changing Home Page Layout

## Context and Problem Statement

The team showed the professor the current project in week 10 to get his opinion since we have only been talking with the TAs. He did not like some aspects of the project. One such area is the home page layout. How should the homepage be reformatted to look better?

## Considered Options

* Use format 1 which is the current format but just changing some backgrounds to match the colors of the login page
* Use format 2 which moves elements around the page and add a moving element that hides elements not currently in use
* Use format 3 which removes or moves elements around the page and add backgrounds to the elements that match the colors of the login page

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: "Use format 3 which removes or moves elements around the page and add backgrounds to the elements that match the colors of the login page", because it matches the teacher's suggestions the most and it would look the best (see below for further details).

## Pros and Cons of the options

### Use format 1 which is the current format but just changing some backgrounds to match the colors of the login page
* Good, because less work since we are focusing on changing the colors and backgrounds and not moving elements around
* Good, because the page will share style integrity with the login page
* Bad, because it wastes a lot of space on the screen
* Bad, because it does not properly display the most important element being the projects
* Bad, because it does not make use of the navigation bar at the top

### Use format 2 which moves elements around the page and add a moving element that hides elements not currently in use
* Good, because the moving element matches the moving element of the login page and its purpose
* Good, because it uses the page space better
* Good, because it has the projects on the left side of the screen and the skill chart on the right side
* Good, because it moves the user id, user picture, search bar, and logout button to the navigation bar at the top
* Good, because the colors and elements will match the login page better
* Bad, because it will take a lot of time to reformat the entire page
* Bad, because it hides elements so users cannot see everything at once

### Use format 3 which removes or moves elements around the page and add backgrounds to the elements that match the colors of the login page
* Good, because the background colors match the login page
* Good, because it uses the page space better
* Good, because it has the projects on the left side of the screen and the skill chart on the right side
* Good, because it moves the user id and logout button to the navigation bar at the top
* Bad, because it will take a lot of time to reformat the entire page
* Bad, because the user picture and search bar elements that have been worked on are removed
