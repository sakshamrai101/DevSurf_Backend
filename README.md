### About the project
Welcome to our developer journal for our software engineering project in CSE 110, Spring 2024 term. Our developer journal allows users to safely save their notes and information for multiple projects as well as keep a list of tasks and milestones for each project. 

## Features
* The journal allows users to register with the application with a User ID and a PIN code so that they can login to access their projects at a later date.
* The journal has a home page that allows users to make and save multiple projects and display some project information as well as project tags that help categorize the projects added.
* The home page also has a user skill radar chart that fills up as more projects are added.
* The projects on the home page also link to project pages that allow for adding and reviewing note entries.
* The projects page also allows users to add a list of milestones to mark progression in the project and add a list of tasks that need to be completed for the project.
* The milestones and tasks that are marked complete will then be displayed on a timeline on the projects page that displays progress.
