## 1) Primary Means of Communication and Expectations
- **Primary Means of Communication**: Slack group 
- All members will be expected to read/respond to messages posted in any of the channels in the team Slack workspace between 6 - 12 hours.

## 2) Meetings
- Teams will meet once, in person for 1 hour (times to be decided based on When2Meet availability) for discussing progress, addressing challenges and for brainstorming sessions.
- In addition to this, all team members are expected to meet informally after each class, for 5-10 minutes to discuss immediate next steps for any assignment/submission.
- Finally, impromptu meetings can be scheduled online on zoom for everyone’s convenience and making steady progress on the project.

## 3) General Responsibilities for All Team Members
- All team members are expected to be kind and courteous with each other in every interaction. Disagreements during meetings or any conversation in the Slack channel, should be conveyed in a healthy constructive manner.
  For example, if dev A disagrees on the use of a certain framework suggested by dev B, instead of disparaging the other person’s opinion, dev A should suggest alternatives and its advantages over the initial framework.
- All members are expected to make it to EVERY team meeting, be it the in-person weekly standup, after class informal meeting or an impromptu online meeting (except for the case where only certain devs are required to meet to fix a bug or resolve a specific issue). In case a team member is not able to show up to a meeting, it’s the concerned individual’s responsibility to reach out to either of the team leads for updates regarding the latest developments.
- All team members are expected to complete their assigned tasks with reasonable quality and under the decided deadline. Any reason prohibiting you to do so should be conveyed to the team in the Slack channel, in advance. This will help the team prepare for such shortcomings beforehand.
- The most important thing to remember is to **COMMUNICATE IN TIME**. All challenges can be resolved if communicated in time, and none can be, if not.

## 4) Specific Team Member Responsibilities/Deadlines (To be updated later)

## 5) Conflict Resolution
- Any conflict between team members in our group should be handled in a 2-step process. First, try the constructive disagreement method highlighted above to resolve conflict/disagreement amongst yourselves. If that does not help or seems to make things worse, bring up the issue with either of the team leads.
- The team leads are required to consult with concerned parties to gather information and then take decisions in the interest of the team and the project deadline. If the situation escalates, the team leads are required to report the issue to the TA or professor.
