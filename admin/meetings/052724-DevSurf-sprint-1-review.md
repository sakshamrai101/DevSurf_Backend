- Members provided kudos on things well done and feedback on changes needed, which everyone agreed to fix - as part of the next sprint.


## Discussion on Individual involvement
- Saksham:  Wrote backend code to register and login user, debugged code in all files, resolved merge conflicts while merging all feature branches, organized and led brainstorming meetings for the first sprint.
- Aniruddh: Worked on the user log-in page pivoting to a PIN code system instead of username and password. I also worked on the JavaScript functionality to ensure the entering of the PIN code is automatically transferred to the adjacent box after the box is input. One of the challenges I faced was working on the JavaScript functionality and the regular expressions to ensure only numbers were input. Screen compatibility was also hard as I was unsure initially of how to layout the login page on smaller screens like the iPhone SE. I then used the media queries appropriately after experimenting with some layouts and also adjusted the JS functionality to work on smaller screens, too.
- Ryan: Worked on implementing the final desired aspects of the timeline. This included the progress bar, the different colored completed tasks, and incorporating the icons for the completed tasks. The hardest part for me was trying to position everything corectly, especially for the images.
- Ricky: Implemented the add button and search button for the home page. Changed the positioning of the elements relative to the other components on the home page and added visual elements to the add button and search button. Hardest part for me was making the components for the 2 interactables so I can grab their inputs later on and use them alongside JS.
- Aditya: Worked on the projects page. Implementing the nav bar and the side bar. The side bar is basically a milestone list with a task list and each milestone has a loading bar which dynamically gets updated on completion of tasks. The hardest part for me was to update the loading bar correctly and dynamically. 
- Ojasvi: Wrote Backend code to enable saving of current user logged in to prevent unecessary relogging in and to keep valid user info easisly accesible in a json file for other js modules.
- Christopher: Worked on the initial designing and drawing up wireframes for the project as well as took many notes and compiled them into the meeting notes and ADRs throughout the process.
- Jason: Worked on the screen compatibility for the projects page. Some challenges I faced were that I didn't really know how to adjust the layout on smaller screens but after some research and experimenting I was able to use media queries to approriately size and layout each element of the project page.
- Brandon: Worked on setting up the HTML for the project card widgets on the home page as well as the CSS styling to match all the other components on the page. 
- Tianshi:  Worked on the user info and stats radar chart on the homepage and the initial functionality as well as the organization of the project card widgets so that it is only 3 in a row and allows for scrolling.
- Shrey: Worked on designing and implementing the notes widget of the Projects page on the application. The widget allows for the developer journal experienece for the user when using our application with a notepad text component that allows a user to write an entry and also attatch any code snippets or screenshots associated for that entry as well as a component that stores all of the entries made by the user as tiles. I worked on the HTML & CSS, as well as the javascript for this component. Additionally, I worked in the team that designed the projects page as a whole. 
- Evan: Design and implemented Navbar component with hamburger menu for the Dev Journal application. Updated home page styling to fit DevSurf color theme. Adjusted item and component alignement with CSS for better visibility of homepage components (statsgraph, userIcon, search bar and project widgets). Began working on homepage responsive design and mobile screensize compatibility.
