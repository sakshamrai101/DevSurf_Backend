# Agile - Retrospective


## What went well
- The team was able to organize and lead multiple in-person meetings to update everyone and share progress.
- Members were able to write and share code, set up multiple branches, and resolve merging conflicts smoothly throughout the development process with help from the CI/CD pipeline.
- The team was able to successfully develop functionality for features such as the project cards, the skill chart, the note entries, the milestone and task lists, and the project timelines.
- The team was able to pivot efficiently and successfully after we got critiques from the Professor and TAs.
- The team was able to code HTML, CSS, and JS and then we were able to validate them and write tests them well.
- All pages were able to be keyboard navigatable and screen size compatible.
- We were able to clear up redundant code and keep the files DRY in the end.

## What didn't go well
- Because our design ideas changed after meeting with the professor, the team had to pivot and we lost some development time.
- Hard to merge different branches together because we did so much work for each branch and diverged from the main branch.
- Because we started working on more backend code late, it led to more bugs, testing, and slow implementation.
- Automated end-to-end testing was not able to be added to the pipeline but was able to be done locally.

## Things that we learned
- Obtain feedback earlier, it would have given us more time to pivot and create a higher quality product.
- The team needs to work on backend functionality earlier.
- The team needs to divide work more efficiently early on.


## Sprint Goal (Things we could do better next time)
- Be more prompt when it comes to completing and sharing work with the team and pushing to the main branch.
- Make better use of the miro board and other tools better.
- We can implement more templates for issues and commit messages and further standardizing the code for projects.
- Next time we can implement more features that we were not able to due to time or scope such as: search bar, reward features, more database use, and more login functionality.
