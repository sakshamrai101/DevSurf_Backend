## Discussion on Individual involvement
- Saksham: Wrote frontend code for the entire first iteration of the homepage (which was further enhanced). Wrote code for login/signup backend. Merged all branches, resloved all merge concflicts. Faciliated team meetings, led brainstroming sessions. Also fixed bugs in all source files at some point. 
- Shrey: Worked on implementing a markdown functionality for users to write in when they make their entry, as well as modyfiying the way in which entries are displayed enhancing the dynamic island that appears when an entry tile is clicked. Worked on adding edit functionality for users to make changes to existing entries, as well as fixing the issue of renumbering the tiles when entries are added and deleted. I also worked on the screen compatability for the notepad and entry tiles so that appears neat and spaced out on smaller screens, as well as merging projects branches to the main branch.  
- Aniruddh: Worked on the styling and screen comparability of the new homepage after re-pivoting from the professor's feedback. Also fixed the bug associated with the logout button on the homepage and collaborated with the projects team on identifying bugs and potential bottlenecks related to screen compatibility. 
- Ryan: Worked on final bug fixes and bug finding for all of the many bugs for project page javascript components from sprint 2. Added the final stylistic changes and implementation of the timeline. Made sure that each project had their own indepenedent milestone, entries, and tasks. Added comments to project page javascript for clarity of the implementation.
- Ricky: Worked on the JS for the home and page edited some components of the home page before it was revamped. Worked on testing alongside Aditya. Worked off of Aditya's already implemented tests for the projects page and created tests for entry functionalities for the project page. I also made my own testing file for the home page and created tests for all the home page functionalities as well as logout button for each page.
- Aditya: Worked on the testing of the project page. Downloaded modules for jest and puppeter, worked on end to end testing, for each function in the javascript. I also worked on the sidebar and the navbar for the projects page.
- Ojasvi: Worked on Backend storage and testing for it. Used jest and set set up tests for each of the functions in DataStorage.js and also worked on implementing those functions.
- Christopher: Worked on small bug fixes and worked on documentation for the project such as detailed meeting notes, ADRs for changes, reviewing code comments for the automated documentation, a roadmap for explaining the progress throughout the project, a system flow diagram for the final project, and filling the miro board with information. 
- Jason: Worked on more styling with the projects page and screensize compatability, adding buttons and functionailty clarity to the milestone list. Changed the style of the nav bar and made sure that every element of the project page was accessible by just using tab and enter. Helped with having a dynamic island appear when a milestone is clicked.
- Brandon: Worked on js functionality for the project and revamped bugs regarding visibility for the widget. Started to create backend connectivity with other aspects of the code.  
- Tianshi: Worked on the implementation and js function of the radar chart, populating data to the chart according to the tags number of project cards. Also fixed styling of the homepage and the radar chart to ensure the chart always in the cneter of the right side of the homepage and add adaptive size to the radar chart according to the screen size.
- Evan: Added Local Storage functionality to project widgets, allowing user's projects, project descriptions and radar char characteristics to stay updated even on refresh and logout/login. Also ensured project widgets + grid layout was responsive to every screen size and mobile compatible. Lastly, made usage of edit project features as intuitive as possible for user experience.
