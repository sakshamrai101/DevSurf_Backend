## Meeting Notes

### Discuss What the Professor and the TA said about the project
- The Professor expressed dissatisfaction with many aspects of the home and projects pages.
- He emphasized that the style integrity needs to remain consistent across the project.
  - He likes the appearance of the login page but did not like how the home and projects page's appearances were much different.
- He suggested a new layout for the homepage due to many reasons:
  - He talked about how a lot of page space was being wasted.
  - He did not like how the main components being the projects were at the bottom of the page instead of being prominently in the front.
  - He suggested moving the search bar away from the middle of the page and towards the top to mimic other websites.
  - He also explained how a hamburger menu for navigation is unnecessary and that the navigation bar at the top should fulfill that purpose.
- He also explained that important elements should be given more attention on the page and for the projects page the notes should be big and large and the other aspects should not take away from its importance.

### Discuss changes that will be made to the homepage
- The home page elements will mimic the professor's suggested outline. The elements would be moves such that:
  - The project cards are on the left side of the screen and should be clear and big.
  - The project layout will now be in a 2x2 grid and still scroll left and right with arrows.
  - The skill chart will be moved to the right side of the screen.
  - The User ID will be displayed in the top right.
  - The logout button will also be displayed in the top right. 
- The home page's appearance should share similarities to the login screen
  - The left side of the screen that displays the projects will have a white background to look similar to the login page.
  - The right side of the screen that displays the skill chart will have a green background to look similar to the login page.
- After discussing how elements of the homepage are rearranged we also discussed removing elements such as: 
  - The search bar will be removed since it is currently unnecessary to search through the projects at the moment since we can still scroll through the projects.
  - The User Picture will be removed since it adds more visual noise to the project and will help simplify stuff for the user.
- We also discussed adding projects from the projects page and agreed to not do that at the moment.
- We did agree on moving the add button to the first project slot.

### Discuss changes that will be made to the project page
- The project page elements will be resized to emphasize the importance of elements as per the professor's suggestion.
  - The notes and entries of the projects will be more prominently displayed
  - The team will also add a clear markdown notes option for adding entries and displaying the markdown notes.
  - The timeline will also be resized and moved a little so that it is clear the notes are the most important.
- The team further discussed elements on the projects page that still need work such as:
  - Adding a character limit for the milestones names so that it does not cause display issues.
  - Add complete and incomplete flags for the milestones on the timeline.
  - In case milestones being marked complete out of order, timeline functionality should be added so that the progress on the timeline should display based on milestones completed in order.
- The team also agreed to remove the code snippets button.
 
## Next Steps
- Push the currently working branches and backend code to the main branch to consolidate the current progress.
- Continue working on tests for the login page and the projects page.
- Complete the changes to the homepage that were discussed in the meeting.
- Complete the changes to the project page that were discussed in the meeting.
- Present changes to the project to the teacher tomorrow after class.
- Next meeting after class on Thursday at 6:30 in Geisel Library.
