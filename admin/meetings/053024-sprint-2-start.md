## Meeting Notes

### Explain the new project setup
- Saksham is setting up a server.js file for the project pages.
- It uses node.js to run the server.js file and the project will be accessible on the web browser through http://localhost:3000.
- It is still being worked on and will be fully implemented next week.

### Discuss current elements of the pages that need work
- The team discussed general components and functionality that need to be added to the project.
- The team agreed that keyboard navigability still needs work and will change as more functionality is added.
- The team also talked about how the pages still need to work on screen size compatibility.
- Changes that need to be made to the projects page include:
  - Adding a save code snippet functionality for the notes.
  - Allowing the notes to be typed using markdown to match a developer's preference.
  - Complete CRUD functionality for the note entries so that you can update and remove them more easily.
  - Allowing the user to edit the task names and properly finish the timeline so that it shows tasks and milestones.
  - Update the appearance of the page so that it reflects the idea of a journal more.
- Changes that need to be made to the home page include:
  - Fixing some bugs with images and icons and element spacing around the page
  - Work on the radar chart and add functionality so that it would update based on projects added.
  - The team also agreed on the radar chart labels being Frontend Engineering, Backend Engineering, Data Analytics Engineering, Network Engineering, and Databases Engineering.
  - Allow the user to add an image to update their user picture.
  - Work on the project card functionality so that clicking on the project names would link to the project page and then populate the project page with the correct project information.
  - Also moving elements around the page to make it more presentable such as moving the add more projects button to the right of the search bar and moving the scroll arrows lower closer to the projects

### Discuss possible ideas and alternative elements for future
- The idea of adding project icons was suggested and discussed by the group and then saved for later due to time.
- The idea of having the user picture change depending on how many projects were added was also suggested. This idea was also saved for later due to time.
- The idea of setting up an offline fallback page was also suggested. This idea was saved for later and will be discussed with the TA.
- The idea of importing project data that you would save from a previous session was also suggested. This idea will also be discussed with the TA.

## Next Steps
- Fix files in the repo to allow for the server.js to work.
- Work on keyboard navigability throughout the project.
- Work on screen size compatibility throughout the project.
- Work on specific components of the homepage:
  - Add js to implement the project cards and skill chart functionality.
  - Move elements around the page according to what the team discussed.
  - Allow users to upload images for the user picture.
  - Fix remaining bugs with spacing and icons.
- Work on specific components of the projects page:
  - Add JS to implement functionality for components as discussed.
  - Add saving code snippet functionality.
  - Add using markdown to adding notes.
  - Implement more CRUD functionality to the project entries.
  - Allow the user to edit task names easily.
  - Display milestones and tasks clearly on the timeline.
- Ask the TA more questions about the project
  - Ask about offline functionality.
  - Ask about importing/exporting project data.
