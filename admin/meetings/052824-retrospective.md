# Agile - Retrospective


## What went well
- The team was able to organize and lead multiple in-person meetings to update everyone and share progress.
- Members were able to write and share code, set up multiple branches, and resolve merging conflicts smoothly throughout the development process with help from the CI/CD pipeline.
- The team was able to successfully develop features like a user info radar chart, a project widget list with scrolling, and a login page with a PIN code login.
- The projects page was also successfully developed including features like a task and milestones list, a place to write and record notes, and a timeline that records progress.

## What didn't go well
- Because our initial ideas changed after the pitch meeting, the team had to pivot and we lost some development time.
- Miscommunication between some members and external factors caused some absences during meetings causing some rescheduling.
- Adjusting and formatting components to match the designs of other components other team members made in CSS.
- Adjusting the pages so that the screens would be compatible with various different sizes and screens.

## Things that we learned
- Gained experience setting up and applying a CI/CD pipeline into our development process.
- Learned how to successfully set up screen size compatibility for smart devices, tablets, and desktops. 


## Sprint Goal
- Be more prompt when it comes to completing and sharing work to the team and pushing to the main branch
- Improve applying the agile process through GitHub issues and pull requests.
